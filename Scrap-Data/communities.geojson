It’s hard enough being a minority, but harder still if we can’t network with others in similar situations!  Secondly, it is our goal to influence the next generation by promoting computer science and related fields to high school students who haven’t yet decided which career path to follow. If we can show young girls how exciting, interesting, and relevant computer science is to their lives, not to mention the massive potential job opportunities there are for them; we can provide positive influence and help young women make informed career decisions. We hope those women can surpass and change what is believed to be normal and take opportunities to work as equals alongside their male peers.  Lastly, by opening events to men we aim to educate them in why encouraging women of all ages and skills is important. We invite them to work side-by-side with us to advocate gender balance in the workplace.",
